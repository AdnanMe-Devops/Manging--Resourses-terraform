5. Create an output variable file called outputs.tf that 

cat > outputs.tf <<'EOF'
output "ips" {
  # join all the instance private IPs with commas separating them
  value = "${join(", ", aws_instance.web.*.private_ip)}"
}
EOF
When you run apply, Terraform loads all files in the directory ending with .tf, so both input and output variable files are loaded.
